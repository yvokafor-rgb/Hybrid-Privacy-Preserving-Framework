        "\n",
        "\n",
        "**Analysis:**\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Accuracy:** There is a significant increase in accuracy from approximately 71.5% to 86.1%. This suggests that the model is now making more correct predictions overall. The higher `eval_threshold` might contribute to this by making the model more conservative in predicting the positive class, thus reducing false positives if the negative class is dominant.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  **Precision:** Precision has increased from approximately 12.2% to 20.1%. This indicates that when the model predicts a positive case, it is more often correct. The higher `eval_threshold` directly contributes to this by requiring a stronger signal to classify a positive case, leading to fewer false positives.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  **Recall:** Recall has decreased from approximately 78% to 62%. This means the model is now identifying a smaller proportion of the actual positive cases. The higher `eval_threshold` makes the model more stringent, potentially missing more true positives but gaining in precision. This is a common trade-off when adjusting the classification threshold.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.  **F1-score:** The F1-score, which is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, has increased from approximately 21.1% to 30.4%. While recall dropped, the notable increase in precision, combined with SMOTE's effect on balancing the dataset (which can improve the model's ability to learn the minority class), has led to an overall better balance between precision and recall as reflected by the F1-score.\n",
        "\n",
        "5.  **ROC AUC:** The ROC AUC has slightly increased from approximately 0.8264 to 0.8366. This metric is independent of the classification threshold and measures the model's ability to distinguish between classes across all possible thresholds. A slight improvement indicates that the model, due to SMOTE, has a slightly better overall discriminative power.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Conclusion:**\n",
        "\n",
        "Applying SMOTE and increasing the `eval_threshold` to 0.7 has resulted in a model with significantly higher overall accuracy and improved precision. However, this comes at the cost of reduced recall. The F1-score shows an overall improvement in the balance between precision and recall, suggesting that these changes have led to a more effective model for this imbalanced dataset, especially if minimizing false positives (improving precision) is a key objective."

        "4.  **F1-score**: The F1-score, which is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, improved from ~0.2114 to ~0.3039. This suggests a better balance between precision and recall, indicating a more effective model overall, especially in handling the imbalanced dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "5.  **ROC AUC**: The ROC AUC score saw a slight improvement, increasing from ~0.8264 to ~0.8366. This metric is robust to class imbalance and changes in the prediction threshold, and its improvement suggests a better overall discriminative ability of the model.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Conclusion:**\n",
        "Applying SMOTE to the training data helped address the class imbalance, leading to a more balanced trade-off between precision and recall. The higher `eval_threshold` of 0.7 made the model more selective in its positive predictions, which improved precision and F1-score, even at the cost of some recall. The overall performance, as indicated by the F1-score and ROC AUC, improved, suggesting that SMOTE and adjusting the evaluation threshold were beneficial for this imbalanced classification problem."

        "### Q&A\n",
        "The effectiveness of SMOTE on precision, combined with a higher evaluation threshold, led to a significant improvement in precision (from 0.1223 to 0.2013). This was achieved by making the model more conservative in its positive predictions.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, this improvement came with a trade-off in recall, which decreased from 0.78 to 0.62. This indicates that while the model's positive predictions are more accurate, it now identifies a smaller proportion of the actual positive cases. Despite the drop in recall, the F1-score, which balances precision and recall, improved from 0.2114 to 0.3039, suggesting a better overall balance and effectiveness for the imbalanced dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Data Analysis Key Findings\n",
        "*   **Precision significantly improved:** Precision increased from approximately 0.1223 (without SMOTE, `eval_threshold=0.5`) to 0.2013 (with SMOTE, `eval_threshold=0.7`), indicating more reliable positive predictions.\n",
        "*   **Recall experienced a trade-off:** Recall decreased from approximately 0.78 to 0.62, meaning the model missed more true positive cases in exchange for higher precision.\n",
        "*   **F1-score showed overall improvement:** The F1-score, a harmonic mean of precision and recall, improved from 0.2114 to 0.3039, suggesting a better balance between precision and recall after applying SMOTE and adjusting the threshold.\n",
        "*   **Accuracy increased notably:** Accuracy rose from 0.7153 to 0.8611, indicating more correct predictions overall, likely due to increased specificity from the higher `eval_threshold`.\n",
        "*   **ROC AUC had a slight gain:** The ROC AUC score saw a minor improvement from 0.8264 to 0.8366, reflecting a slightly better overall discriminative ability of the model.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Insights or Next Steps\n",
        "*   The combination of SMOTE and an increased evaluation threshold effectively optimized the model for higher precision, which is beneficial in scenarios where minimizing false positives is critical, even at the cost of some recall.\n",
        "*   Further hyperparameter tuning for SMOTE or exploring other oversampling/undersampling techniques, along with an optimized `eval_threshold` (e.g., using a precision-recall curve), could potentially achieve an even better balance between precision and recall without significant trade-offs.\n"
